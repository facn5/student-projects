### Example Issue:

<hr />

#### Name
Michael

#### Describe the problem you'd like to solve
My grandparents have dementia and find it very hard to go out and do simple tasks like shopping. They don't have many friends and not many people come to visit them.

#### Who are the stakeholders?
My grandparents. People with dementia. The elderly. Families of people with dementia. The NHS. Care homes.

#### What is currently being done to solve this problem?
They have family who help them, but family members don't always communicate well together about what they're doing to help.
Care homes can provide for people with dementia, but this can mean that they see less of their family and forget about them.
